### Rest API

Java REST API with Springboot version 2. I implemented a simple RESTful web service for communication between different services. The service sends HTTP requests to the server to fetch the student's data in h2 DB and responds with JSON/XML data. It follows REST/SOLID principles for scalability and maintainability.
